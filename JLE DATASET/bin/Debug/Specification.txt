This is a fake file. We do not validate the XML against a DTD, but our
parser need this DTD line, even though it does not use it.
As far as I know, this file never actually existed...

> <Edition.Page.Ordre>1</Edition.Page.Ordre> 

* this is the numbering of the articles within a page. It only applies
if a single page contains more than one article. It is used to order the
articles in the table of contents on the website (as in: ORDER BY
"Edition.Page.Debut", "Edition.Page.Ordre")

> <JLE.DatePubli>2010-09-01</JLE.DatePubli> 

* this is the date at which the article will be/is available on the
website, which is usually (perhaps always, as JLE could confirm) the
same as "JLE.DateParu". A future date will prevent the article from
being displayed. As of the current production process, this date is
usually in the past.

> <JLE.DateParu>2010-09-01</JLE.DateParu> 

* this is the date of the issue, in date format (year + month + day),
ie. when it should be available on shelves; this is the same date as
"JLE.Lib.Paru", but written in formal date format.

> <JLE.Lib.Paru>septembre 2010</JLE.Lib.Paru> 

* this is the label for the date of the issue, as written on the paper;
it is equivalent to "JLE.DateParu", but without a formal format. It
could be "septembre 2010", or "juillet-août 2010", or "winter 2010" if
need be. This is displayed on the issue page in the website.

> <JLE.Gratuit>0</JLE.Gratuit>

* this is a boolean (written as an integer, 0 or 1), telling us if the
article should be free on the website or not. A single article per issue
is free (ie. viewable without paying) on the website. JLE decides which
one, and forwards this information to you. As soon as the article is
imported on the website, it's "free-status" is known and enforced (there
is an option to change this status manually on the website back-office,
but this would make it known long after the article is online).

Hello,

The XML created by Thomson and imported into the site contains two forms JLE
different for each date of publication:
<JLE.DateParu> 2008-05-01 </ JLE.DateParu>
<JLE.Lib.Paru> May-June 2008 </ JLE.Lib.Paru>

The first field, the ISO date format, used to sort, filter, etc.. The
second field is a label free, just used for display,
and represents the date or time of publication.

For monthly magazines, filling is simple:
* JLE.DateParu: the first month of release, or "2012-02-01"
* JLE.Lib.Paru: corresponding label, ie "February 2012"
For bi-monthly or less frequent journals, logic would
therefore:
* JLE.DateParu: first the first month of the publication period, or
"2012-01-01" ("the first day of the period")
* JLE.Lib.Paru: label corresponding to the entire period,
"January-February 2012"

The wording is totally free, of course we accept "First
quarter of 2012 ", the formal date of issue remaining well
"2012-01-01" (the first day of the "first quarter").

Of recent imports contained data wacky, as in
mtg-13-3:
    <JLE.DateParu> 2012-1-01 </ JLE.DateParu>
    <JLE.Lib.Paru> July 2011 </ JLE.Lib.Paru>
or
    <JLE.Lib.Paru> July 8 </ JLE.Lib.Paru>

* Format "2012-1-01" is not correct, but was probably
accepted, otherwise we would have been a mistake
* The language "July 2011" and the date "2012-01-01" not at all
consistent (the same for "July 8" ...)

For mtg-13-2:
    <JLE.DateParu> 2011-10-01 </ JLE.DateParu>
    <JLE.Lib.Paru> April-June 2011 </ JLE.Lib.Paru>
* Should be the date "2011-04-01", or the wording should be
"October-December 2011"

Even if a publication is designed, processed, or imported several months
after the theoretical date of publication, the JLE.DateParu should always
be the first day of the period represented by
<JLE.Lib.Paru>.
Another XML field, JLE.DatePubli, may contain the effective date of
publication of each article when it was created, processed or
imported, according to your constraints (this date can be different
for each item, and may be optionally after the very
JLE.DateParu)

I leave Baptist transmit to the persons concerned in JLE.

Good day to all!
