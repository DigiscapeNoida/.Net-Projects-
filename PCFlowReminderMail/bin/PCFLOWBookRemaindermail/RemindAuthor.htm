Dear Author,<br><br>The proof for chapter &quot;[CT]&quot; from your book &quot;[BT]&quot; is now ready to access in an online proofing system, Proof Central. The system provides two options for making your corrections: online, or via PDF. Please note that only one option may be selected. Please click on the following link for access to your proof<br><a href="[PCURL]">[PCURL]</a> <br><br>You can find author instructions <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/proof-central">here</a>, together with detailed <a href="http://live.elsevierproofcentral.com/proofcentral/proof/help/[JID]">here</a> (if necessary).<br><br>Please read the proofs carefully to verify accuracy and answer all queries marked &quot;Q&quot; (author). Also, ensure that your name and your co-author's names are in full and are correct, any changes in your affiliations should be updated in the chapter opening page (if applicable).<br><br>Please note that this will be your <b>only</b> opportunity to make corrections. Material may be updated where appropriate, but rewriting is to be avoided, as extensive changes are both costly and time-consuming. (Note: if using the PDF option, please try to avoid making corrections using sticky notes as much as possible, instead add corrections by using replace text or insert text options.)<br><br><b>For multi-authored books:</b> If your chapter has been written by more than one author, I will only be sending this link to you, the corresponding author. You will be responsible for ensuring that all of the contributor's corrections have been included in this one master set, which will be sent to me. This ensures that there are no conflicting corrections and that we have the most updated and complete corrections to incorporate into proofs. For more information on how to manage multiple corrections please check <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/proof-central#proofing-options">here</a>.<br><br>I would be grateful if you could return your corrections to me by <b>[DUEDATE]</b>.<br><br>If you anticipate any difficulties in returning the corrections by this date, or have any questions about the proof review, please let me know.<br> <br>Thank you for your cooperation and I look forward to receiving your comments.<br><br>[PM]<br>Project Manager<br>Elsevier
