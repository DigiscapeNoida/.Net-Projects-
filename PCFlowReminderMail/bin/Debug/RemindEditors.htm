Dear Editor,<br><br>The proof for chapter &quot;[CT]&quot; from your book &quot;[BT]&quot; is now ready to access in Proof Central, our online proofing system. You will be presented with one of the two options for making your corrections: online, or via PDF. The option that you are presented with will follow the option selected by the author. Please click on the following link for access to your proof:<br><br><a href="[PCURL]">[PCURL]</a> <br><br>You can find instructions <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/proof-central">here</a>, together with detailed <a href="http://live.elsevierproofcentral.com/proofcentral/proof/help/[JID]">here</a> (if necessary).<br><br>The proofs have already been sent to the corresponding author and they should have answered all marked &quot;Q&quot; (author). <br><br>
Please read the proofs carefully to verify accuracy as that this will be your only opportunity to make corrections. Material may be updated where appropriate, but rewriting is to be avoided, as extensive changes are both costly and time-consuming. (Note: if using the PDF option, please try to avoid making corrections using sticky notes as much as possible; instead add corrections by using replace text or insert text options.)
<br>
<br>
I would be grateful if you could complete your proof review by <b>[DUEDATE]</b>.
<br>
<br>
If you anticipate any difficulties in returning the corrections by this date, or have any questions about the proof review, please let me know.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your cooperation and I look forward to receiving your comments
<br><br>[PM]<br>Project Manager<br>Elsevier
