They influence globalization through the mobility and trade relations they support, business and social interactions, the organization of value chains, as well as manufacturing and distribution conveyances such as vehicles, aircrafts, and ships. Freight transportation is particularly unnoticed even if globalization depends on the mobility of raw materials, parts, and finished goods. This freight mobility is also complemented by the mobility of people through borders for purposes such as business, tourism, and even migration.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="ks0010" class="keyword"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text id="txt0010">Air transportation</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0015"><ce:text id="txt0015">Freight</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0020"><ce:text id="txt0020">Global economy</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0025"><ce:text id="txt0025">Logistics</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0030"><ce:text id="txt0030">Maritime transportation</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0035"><ce:text id="txt0035">Passengers</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0040"><ce:text id="txt0040">Rail transportation</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0045"><ce:text id="txt0045">Transport modes</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords><ce:sections><ce:section id="s0010"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Introduction: Modes as the Linchpin of the Global Economy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0010">Transportation modes are the conveyances used to support the mobility of passengers and freight (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0020" refid="bib0040">Sultana and Weber,&nbsp;2017</ce:cross-ref>). The substantial diversity, availability, and affordability of goods in the global economy much depend on the capacity to transport them. For instance, a mobile phone manufactured (assembled) in China embarks in a complex journey, involving a multitude of stages with transport modes such as trucks, containerships and trains, and with transport facilities such as ports, railyards, and distribution centers, to ensure that it reaches global markets. This does not even consider the staggering array of movements related to the components of this device. For passengers, increasing international interactions linked with social interactions, business transactions, tourism, sport events and migration has been an ongoing trend. The mobility of passengers and freight within the global economy must thus be supported by transportation modes, terminals, and infrastructures (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0025" refid="bib0015">Black,&nbsp;2003</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0015">This chapter is organized as follows: The first section provides an historical perspective behind the emergence of major transportation modes and their impacts on globalization. The second section underlines the benefits of intermodalism. The third section looks that two fundamental modes supporting international mobility, maritime, and air transport. The fourth section focuses about how logistics allows for the organization of modes supporting global supply chains.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section-title id="st0025">The Emergence of a Global Transportation System</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0020">International transportation predates globalization since for as long that there has been trade, transportation modes have been its conveyances. One is the prerequisite for the other; they are both mutually interdependent. The history of transportation modes is a proxy of the history of globalization with the volume, capacity, speed, and efficiency of transport modes evolving (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0030" refid="bib0010">Bernstein,&nbsp;2008</ce:cross-ref>). As economies and societies emerged, axis of trade and circulation came into existence. One of the first major &ldquo;international&rdquo; trade route was the Silk Road, its name taken from the prized Chinese textile that flowed from Asia to the Middle East and Europe. The Silk Road consisted of a succession of trails followed by caravans through Central Asia. Since the transport capacity was limited, taking place over long distance and often unsafe, luxury goods were the only commodities that could be traded. The Silk Road also helped the diffusion of ideas and religions (initially Buddhism and then Islam), enabling civilizations from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia to interact. The road endured from the 2nd century BC to the 15th century when more efficient maritime transportation helped its downfall. A rudimentary system of international trade was thus permitted.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0025">The transport system of the Roman Empire put in place between the 3rd century BC and the 2nd century AD was a fundamental component of a Mediterranean system of trade with two interdependent transport systems; the road and short distance, coastal, maritime shipping. The Mediterranean Ocean provided a central role to support trade between the major cities of Empire, most of them being located along the coast (e.g., Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Cartage). These cities were serviced by a road network permitting trade within their respective hinterlands. For instance, the world&apos;s first dual carriageway, Via Portuensis, was built to link Rome and the port of Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber River. At the peak of the Roman Empire around 200 CE, its road system covered about 80,000 kilometers, but once the empire collapsed in the 5th century, the road system fell into disrepair and became fragmented.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0030">It is, however, with long distance maritime transportation that more globally oriented economic systems were permitted, with the creation of commercial empires. Initially, ships were propelled by rowers, and sails were added around 2,500 BC as a complementary form of propulsion. China was one of the first to establish an important fluvial transport network with several artificial canals connected to form the Grand Canal. At its peak in the 15th century, the canal system totaled 2500 kilometers, with some parts still being used today. By Medieval times, an extensive maritime trade network, the highways of the time, centered along the navigable rivers, canals, and coastal waters of Europe was established. Shipping was extensive and sophisticated using the English Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean where the most important cities were coastal or inland ports. Still, transportation was mainly a short distance and very risky endeavor with long distance maritime routes mainly controlled by Arab merchants linking the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0035">By the 14th century galleys were finally replaced by full-fledged sailships (the caravel and then the galleon) that were faster and required smaller crews. In total, 1431 marked the beginning of the European expansion with the discovery by the Portuguese of the North Atlantic circular wind pattern, better known as the trade winds. A similar pattern was also found on the Indian and Pacific oceans with the monsoon winds (long discovered by the Arabs). The ensuing era of colonialism was mainly the era of the sailship, linking Europe with the rest of the world. Although shipping services were rather sporadic, large colonial empires such as those of the Spanish, British, French, and Dutch were the early expression of a global economy supported by the sailship. For instance, the Dutch East Asian Company, founded in 1602, can be considered as one of the first multinational corporations. By 1750, it employed around 25,000 people and did business in more than 10 countries, mainly from the Dutch colony of Indonesia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0040">The beginning of the 19th century saw the establishment of the first regular maritime routes linking port cities worldwide, especially over the North Atlantic between Europe and North America. Sailships became increasingly efficient, with some like the Clipper ships mainly designed for speed more than for cargo holding. These &ldquo;express&rdquo; cargo ships dominated long distance ocean trade until the late 1850s when they were gradually replaced by steamships. Another significant improvement resided in the elaboration of accurate navigation charts where prevailing winds and sea currents could be used to the advantage of navigation. The improvement of steam engine technology permitted longer and safer voyages. The first regular services for transatlantic passenger transport by steamships were inaugurated in 1838 and until the mid-20th century, Liners accounted for most of international passenger travel. In the 1840s, it took about 12&nbsp;days for a Liner to cross to Atlantic, a figure that dropped to 4&nbsp;days in the 1930s.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0045">By the end of the 19th century additional improvements in engine propulsion technology and a gradual shift from coal to oil as a fuel increased the speed and the capacity of maritime transport. Energy consumption by maritime shipping was reduced, and coal refueling stages were bypassed. An equal size oil-powered ship could transport more freight than a coal-powered ship, reducing operation costs considerably and extending its range. Global maritime circulation was also dramatically improved when shortcuts such as the Suez (1869) and the Panama (1914) canals, were constructed. With the Suez Canal, the far reaches of Asia and Australia became more accessible, while the Panama Canal considerably reduced the time it took to link the Atlantic to the Pacific.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0050">The capacity of maritime shipping also increased with the specialization of ships, which enabled to move low-cost bulk commodities such as minerals and grain over long distances. The size of oil tankers grew substantially, especially after World War II when global energy demands surged. Maritime routes were thus expanded to include tanker routes, notably from the Middle East, the dominant global producer of oil. To this day, energy trades are among the foremost forms of modal globalization as they concern large quantities of goods usually carried over long distances.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0055">The airline industry has also played a significant role in supporting the emergence of a global economy. It began with air mail services since they initially proved to be more profitable than transporting passengers. 1919 marked the first commercial air transport service between England and France, but air transport suffered from limitations in terms of capacity and range. The late 1920s and 1930s saw the expansion of regional and national air transport services in Europe and the United States with successful propeller aircrafts such as the Douglas DC-3. The post-World War II period was, however, the turning point for air transportation as the range, capacity, and speed of aircrafts increased. A growing number of people were able to afford the speed and convenience of air transportation. In 1958, the first commercial jet plane, the Boeing 707, entered in service and revolutionized international movements of passengers, marking the end of liner ships, leaving the maritime passenger sector to the niche markets of cruises and ferries. The cruise ship became a new mode of globalization in the tourism industry, offering itineraries in a variety of regional markets. The availability of the Boeing 747 in the early 1970s truly made air transport a global industry. Still, passenger transportation is a marginal, albeit visible, component of globalization.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0060">By the second half of the 20th century, many international transportation systems were in place, forming the basis of a global transport system and reinforced by a global telecommunication network. Fundamental changes were about to take place as the role of transportation evolved. From a situation where transportation was a simple infrastructure permitting and supporting trade and mobility, transportation became a factor shaping global production and markets. The fragmentation of the production and an international division of labor increased the quantity of freight in circulation. Containers have been particularly important in this regard. Introduced in the late 1950s, containers became the main agents of the modern international transport system.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Connecting Modes: Containerization and Intermodal Transportation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0065">While modal transportation is the mean supporting global mobility, intermodalism allows for the connectivity within and between large systems of circulation (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0035" refid="bib0030">Rodrigue,&nbsp;2017</ce:cross-ref>). The container epitomizes this connectivity in the freight sector as a load unit that can be used by several transport modes. Maritime, railway, and road modes are all able to handle containers, increasing the flexibility of freight transport, mainly by reducing transshipment costs and delays. Containerization underlines a growing relationship between freight transportation modes and a standardization of loads. The container has a reference size of 20 feet long, 8 feet high, and 8 feet wide, corresponding to a 20-foot equivalent unit. The most common containers are 40 feet in length, permitting them to fit well on a ship, truck, or railcar.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0070">By using respective modes in the most productive manner, the line-haul economies of maritime shipping and rail may be used for long distances, with the efficiencies of trucks providing local distribution. The entire transport sequence is now seen as a whole, rather than as a series of stages, each marked by an individual operation with separate sets of documentation and rates. Containers have become the most important component for rail and maritime intermodal transportation, enabling them to interact closely and conferring significant time and cost savings.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0075">Most major ports have been transformed to become container ports with the construction of new container transshipment infrastructures. These infrastructures accommodate containerships, ships built solely for the purpose of carrying stacked containers. For rail, new facilities were also required to handle container traffic as well as specialized railcars. The double stacking of containers on railways has doubled the capacity of trains to haul freight with minimal cost increases, thereby improving the competitive position of railways with regards to trucking for long distance shipments. Road transportation has also adapted to containerization, but the requirements are minimal with chassis able to latch in containers.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0080">Intermodal transport is transforming a growing share of freight distribution across the globe. Large integrated transport carriers provide door-to-door services through a sequence of modes, terminals, and distribution centers. Transportation, in terms of modes and routing, is no longer of much concern for customers, if shipments reach their destinations within an expected cost and time range. The concerns are therefore mainly with cost and level of service. For the customer of intermodal transport services, transportation, and distance appear to be meaningless, but for the intermodal providers routing, costs, and service frequencies are important. Therefore intermodalism and globalization makes specific transport modes less visible to the users but requires move visibility for modal operators to effectively manage.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Transportation Modes and International Mobility</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0085">International transportation systems have been under increasing pressures to support the growing demands of international trade and the globalization of production and consumption (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0040" refid="bib0025">Dicken,&nbsp;2015</ce:cross-ref>). This could not have occurred without considerable technical improvements permitting to transport larger quantities of freight and people, and this more quickly and more efficiently. Since containers and intermodal transportation improve the efficiency of global distribution, a growing share of general cargo moving globally is containerized. Transportation is often referred as an enabling factor that is not necessarily the cause of international trade, but a mean over which globalization could not have occurred without.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0090">Because of the geographical scale of the global economy, most international freight flows circulate over several modes. Transport chains must be established to service these requirements, which reinforce the importance of transportation modes and terminals at strategic locations. International trade requires distribution infrastructures that can support its volume and extent. Two transportation modes are specifically supporting globalization and international trade; maritime and air transportation. Road and railways tend to account for a marginal share of international transportation since they are above all modes for national or regional transport services. However, a substantial share of the trade between Canada, United States, and Mexico is supported by trucking, as well as large share of the Western European trade. China with its Belt and Road Initiative has also spearheaded long distance rail transport services across Eurasia.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Maritime Transport</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0095">The growth of maritime transportation has been fueled by many issues. First, there is an increase in energy and mineral cargoes derived from a growing demand of developing economies. Second, global value chains have resulted in additional demands for long distance trade. Third, improvements in ship and maritime terminals have facilitated the flows of freight, particularly containerized traffic (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0045" refid="bib0035">Stopford,&nbsp;2009</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0100">Weight-wise, about 80% of the world trade is carried by maritime transportation, which account for 70% of its value. About half of this trade is handled by large containerships linking producers and consumers along sea lanes. This transportation system is organized around major maritime transport gateways where continental trade converges, namely Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Busan for Pacific Asia, Rotterdam and Antwerp for Europe and Los Angeles/Long Beach and New York for North America, among the largest container ports in the world (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0050" refid="f0010">Fig.&nbsp;1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0105">Economic development in East Asia has been the dominant factor behind the growth and the changes of international transportation in recent years. Since the distances involved are often considerable, this has resulted in increasing demands on the maritime shipping industry and on port activities. As its manufacturing base developed, China was importing growing quantities of raw materials and energy and exporting growing quantities of manufactured goods. The outcome has been a surge in demands for international transportation, but also problems of imbalanced trade. The ports in the Pearl River delta in Guangdong province now handle almost as many containers as all the ports in the United States combined.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Air Transport</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0110">The role of air transportation in the global economy is substantial as a support for passenger and freight mobility (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0055" refid="bib0020">Bowen,&nbsp;2010</ce:cross-ref>). For the mobility of goods, it accounts for about 13% of the value of international trade with goods of a high value to weight ratio such as electronics account for this preponderance. Further, the fast delivery of parcels from e-commerce, which substantially leans on air transport, is a dominant segment of the air freight industry. Traditionally, freight was carried in the bellyhold of passenger airplanes and provided supplementary income for airline companies. However, specialized cargo-only airplanes as well as specialized air freight carriers are becoming dominant. This goes on par with a level of specialization of airports particularly in the United States, where centrally located airports such as Memphis and Louisville are handling a large share of the freight. Pacific Asian airports such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Inchon have also a significant preponderance as air freight gateways for Asian exports (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0060" refid="f0015">Fig.&nbsp;2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0015"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0115">Passenger air travel is linked with the level of economic development and the structure of the regional urban system. While most air travel concerns short distances (less than 2&nbsp;hours of flight time), international passenger movements are dominated by air transport. There are three major concentrations of airports around which the world&apos;s air traffic is articulated: North America, Western Europe, and East Asia. The key airports of these platforms, or rather the main airport cities since many metropolitan areas have more than one airport correspond to the world&apos;s most prominent cities and the most important financial centers. Yet, this supremacy is being challenged by new hubs of activity such as Beijing and Dubai. There is a direct relationship between the level of air passenger traffic and the primacy of a city in the world urban system. In some cases, the level of passenger activity is related to a pronounced touristic or resort function of an area (e.g., Las Vegas, Orlando, Cancun, Venice, Palma de Mallorca). Air travel is therefore a complex mix of business, personal and leisure derived mobility (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0065" refid="f0020">Fig.&nbsp;3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>).<!--<query id="Q3">Please check the suggested citation of Fig. 3 for correctness and confirm if it is okay.</query>--></ce:para><ce:para id="p0120">Large airport terminals are also seeing a substantial concentration of related activities such as distribution centers, just-in-time manufacturers, office parks, hotels, restaurants, and convention centers. These activities have a notable global orientation in terms of their customer base.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Logistics: Producing, Organizing, and Managing Transportation Modes in a Global Economy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0125">The complex web of global production, transportation, and consumption requires managerial efforts. Logistics is the series of activities required for goods to be made available on markets. This mainly includes purchase, orders processing, inventory management, and transportation. As the range of production expanded, transport modes adapted to new demands in freight distribution where the reliability and timely deliveries can be as important as costs. Logistics has consequently taken an increasingly important role in the global economy, supporting a wide array of value chains. First, improvement in transport efficiency expanded the geographical range of value chains. Second, the wide diffusion of information technologies allowed corporations to establish a better level of control over their value chains. Third, technological improvements such as intermodal transportation, enabled an increased continuity between different transport modes and thus within value chains.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0130">The results have been a decrease of the friction of distance and a spatial division of production. This process is strongly imbedded with the capacity and efficiency of international and regional transportation modes, especially maritime and land routes. It is becoming rare for the production stages of a good to occur at the same location, even within a region. Consequently, value chains are integrated with transport modes with logistics as a strategy used to reduce time. For instance, value chains are also becoming increasingly managed by demand, implying that what is being produced is done so to match as closely as possible to what is being consumed. Logistics services are becoming complex and time-sensitive to the point that many firms are subcontracting parts of their distribution activities to specialized logistics providers operating their own modal assets.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0135">An important aspect in the development of transportation modes concerns their manufacturing, which has taken a global dimension. The manufacturing of vehicles such as cars or trucks is mostly for regional use, but the sourcing of parts is commonly global with a propensity to cluster around major assembly plants. Further, exports of assembled vehicles to foreign markets is substantial for vehicles manufactured in Germany, Japan, and Korea, underlining a high level of globalization for both manufacturing and distribution. For aircraft manufacturing, one of the most complex and advanced engineering achievements, centralized final assembly plants, such as in Renton and Everett (Washington, United States) for Boeing commercial jets, are using parts supplied by thousands of manufacturers across the world. The end products have a global market as 70% of Boeing sales concerns customers outside the United States. In a similar fashion, Airbus assembles most of its planes in Toulouse (France) and Hamburg (Germany) from parts mainly provided from across the European Union. For the maritime shipping industry, 90% of the shipbuilding takes place in China, South Korea, and Japan, for conveyances that are used for long distance freight distribution.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Conclusion: Transportation Modes in a Globalized Economy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0140">Globalization has been supported and expended by the development of modern transport modes. From large containerships to cars and delivery trucks, distribution systems have become closely integrated linking manufacturing activities with global markets. However, the 21st century brings many challenges to the role of transportation modes in the global economy. The capacity of many segments of transport system has been stretched by additional demands tying up long distance transportation modes supporting the mobility of passengers and freight. Congestion in many international transport terminals such as ports often causes delays and unreliable deliveries, and there is an acute need for improving inland transportation systems, notably those linked to the major gateways of the global economy. At the urban level, congestion, which is a local phenomenon, is often associated with regional and global distribution such as e-commerce. While developed economies have been able to provide substantial resources in coping with modal demands, many developing economies are facing challenges to provide infrastructures able to support an ongoing demand.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Cross References</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0145"><ce:list id="l0010"><ce:list-item id="u0010"><ce:para
