The first is the requirement for land sites where the ships can berth: a port. The second concerns the port&apos;s relationships with inland markets: a regional perspective. The paper examines the changes that are transforming ports as site activities: the challenges of congestion, managing technological change, urban conflicts, and governance reform; and, the issues in expanding intermodal services inland, and dry ports. The paper concludes by considering four issues that are likely to shape the port of the future: the energy transition, automation and digitalization, cybersecurity, and climate change.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="ks0010"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text id="txt0010">Containerization</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0015"><ce:text id="txt0015">Dry ports</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0020"><ce:text id="txt0020">Intermodalism</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0025"><ce:text id="txt0025">Port governance</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0030"><ce:text id="txt0030">Port rationalization</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0035"><ce:text id="txt0035">Port-city dynamics</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0040"><ce:text id="txt0040">Ports</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords><ce:sections><ce:para id="p0010">While maritime transport is a mode that obviously depends upon seas and oceans, it possesses distinctive and critically important territorial dimensions. Ships have to exchange their cargoes and passengers at sites on land, and it is with terrestrial-bound customers that their revenue-generating business depends. The territorial dimensions of maritime transport are therefore of fundamental importance.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0015">Ports are the points of contact between ships and land. Ships require sites that they can access and where they can dock safely. Accessibility and safety are the most fundamental requirements of a port. Ships must also be able to load and/or discharge their cargoes efficiently. This requires port infrastructures involving quay walls, terminal space, and equipment that are capable of achieving ship turnarounds with the minimum of delays. From a shipping perspective ports are land-based facilities that are absolutely essential to maritime trade.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0020">Ports also serve wider functions on land. They are essential components of supply chains that link producers and consumers. For many supply chains the maritime link may be the longest spatially or timewise, but the landward connections between the port and the original producer or final consumer are the connections that account for the highest costs and present challenges for on-time performance. Landward links from ports have become a critical concern for customers and represent one of the most difficult challenges in global supply chains.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0025">This article examines these two territorial dimensions of maritime transport. The first considers the port as a land site that carries out specific functions for shipping. It is an urban land use with a very distinctive character, one that has undergone significant change. Because it occupies waterfront sites it frequently enters into conflict with other land uses. The second dimension is its regional importance. Ports serve markets, and these are becoming more extensive and competitive in many cases. Ports, and the actors who comprise the port community, seek to extend and strengthen the linkages, so that the port region, or hinterland, becomes a means of securing traffic and strengthening competitiveness.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0010"><ce:section-title id="st0020">The Port as a Land Use<!--<query id="Q1">Please check all the heading levels for hierarchical correctness.</query>--></ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0030">For maritime transport a key territorial requirement has always been that of a site where ships can shelter and load and discharge their cargoes with safety and efficiency. Favored port sites were where natural features provided protection from storms and where there was sufficient depth of water to allow access. Over time, and dependent upon traffic growth, physical infrastructures such as wharves were built to facilitate loading and unloading from ship to shore and artificial barriers were constructed to provide protection. The port area became a distinct zone but was integrated within the general urbanized area. The trade passing through generated economic multipliers due to the manpower employed in the port itself, in the manufacturing industry that processed goods shipped through the port, and in the transport related businesses that managed its trade and commerce. It is not surprising that many port cities became major urban centers, such as London, Hamburg, Marseilles, Genoa, New York, New Orleans, Shanghai, and Tokyo.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0035">Over time ships changed from wooden craft powered by sail to steel ships powered by fossil fuels. The repercussions of these technological developments were significant particularly with regard to speed, but their impacts on ports were not substantial because the capacities of ships remained constrained by the ability of ports to load and unload cargoes efficiently. Port operations were labor intensive. Freight was brought from storage sheds to dockside using animal and human labor; the goods lowered by sling and pulleys into ships&rsquo; holds, wherein gangs of men had to secure the freight, an extremely dangerous procedure. All kinds of cargoes were involved, from raw materials to packages and barrels, of different shapes and sizes. Loading and unloading took time, and vessels were laid up in port for weeks. Thus there were diseconomies of scale in shipping since increasing the size of the ship would result in longer port calls and still fewer potential revenue-generating trips per year.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0040">The most important factors precipitating the changes were market conditions and the mechanization of port operations. The earliest market sectors to change were the bulk trades, because the global economic and population growth that occurred after the end of World War II generated increased demands for liquid bulk (oil) and dry bulk (coal, iron ore, and grain). Because these were products that could be handled more easily than others, using pumps and conveyer belts, they permitted scale economies to be realized, and in both sectors vessel size increased dramatically. In 1951 the largest tanker had a capacity of 20,000 DWT (deadweight tons), while the typical size of a dry bulk ship was 10,000 DWT. By the late 1970s maximum tanker size had increased to over 300,000 DWT. The growth of dry bulk carriers has been slower but the maximum size by the 2010s has reached 400,000 DWT.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0045">The transformation of general cargo handling in the ports of the world remained largely unchanged until the mid 1960s after the introduction of the container. Its concept may have been simple, but the economic consequences of the container have been profound. Standardizing the unit load allowed rapid transfers of cargo across quay walls by cranes that slot the containers one on top of other in the holds of ships. The storage of containers and their repositioning in the terminal could now be mechanized too. Because of the mechanization, vessel turnarounds could be achieved far more rapidly than before, so that instead of ships spending weeks in port their turnarounds today are measured in hours. As with the bulk trades the size of container ships increased as a result the increased efficiency of handling. The first cellular ships of the early 1970s had capacities of 1000 TEUs (20 foot equivalent units). Size increased to 5,000 TEUs by the late 1980s, 10,000 TEUs by the end of the 20th century, and 20&nbsp;years later the largest container vessels exceed 21,000 TEUs.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0050">As much as the increasing size of ships was made possible by growth in international trade and economies of scale, it must not be forgotten that ports have played a significant role. It has been their ability to exchange cargoes between land and ships more efficiently that made the growth in vessel size possible. In turn ports were transformed. Larger capacity vessels require deeper channels, longer berths, and more storage space as well as more expensive handling equipment. Existing docks sites were rarely suitable, and so new larger sites had to be developed and equipped. In most cases new terminals were built on greenfield sites some distance from the port city. The effects of the changes have been to change the character and functioning of ports themselves and to alter the dynamics between ports and the cities.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section-title id="st0025">The Changing Character of Port Sites</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0055">The ability of ports to respond to the growth of traffic and the increase in the size of ships have required significant capital investments. While the shipping industry itself has had to invest heavily in new vessels, a great deal of the costs of has been borne by the ports themselves. Satisfying this demand represents significant capital costs for port authorities, either through relocation to extensive sites adjacent to deep water or for dredging. There are differences between bulk and general cargo concerning the capital costs of developing new terminals. This is because they possess different operational, ownership, and organizational characteristics. Bulk shipping involves freight that is handled in large quantities at terminals owned or leased by corporations whose shipments are components of industrial supply chains controlled by the corporations. They use ships that are owned or leased by the same corporations. Fluctuations in traffic are shaped by broad market conditions. In contrast, general cargo (largely containerized today) is transported by independent carriers that operate between ports on regular liner services, who charge rates according to demand, and serve a wide range of customers from small shippers to giant retailers. The terminals are built by port authorities who, in some cases operated the terminals, but more frequently lease them to terminal operators. There is a high degree of uncertainty in this business: the shipping lines are footloose and have freedom shift services to competing ports, and the terminal operating companies have little control over traffic volumes. Port authorities have to attract carriers in order to secure business and have to invest heavily in terminals with no guarantee of success.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0060">The capital requirements for port development raise a number of questions that have led to different solutions. The first set of questions arises out of port governance. Up until World War II, ports in most countries were owned by central governments and operated as a public service. The costs of providing the services and the ability of a public authority to manage a resource in the competitive field of containerization resulted demands for reform in port governance. The UK and New Zealand opted for total privatization; many others adopted a system of commercialization while retaining nominal public control. Others, under the control of municipalities such as those in Northern Europe, remained largely unchanged. Academic studies of the success of port reforms are numerous, but the results are inconclusive. The major issue is that as much as port reform has led to greater efficiencies, the capital requirements still require financial support from national governments, many of which are reluctant to undertake either because of the demands other more popular projects, or because of uncertainties of outcomes. In some countries, such as Canada, where port reform took place 20&nbsp;years ago, the issue of privatization or other models of governance are presently under discussion.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0065">A second issue concerning port expansion is that of public acceptability. Port activities now take place in relative isolation from their host cities. Their sites are extensive and located beyond the daily routine movements of most residents. In addition, they are gated and fenced off, because of international regulations on port security. Many residents see ports in a negative light because they are perceived to cause pollution by the refineries and smelters in the port zones, and they generate traffic that clogs urban highways. An important additional factor is that the direct benefits of jobs that tied the port to the city in the past have diminished. The number of dockworkers has fallen by over 90% in some ports, and although the remaining unionized workers are well-paid, there is evidence that other workers dependent on the ports, such as warehouse workers and truckers, have seen their salaries decline in constant dollars over the years. It is no surprise therefore that the port is no longer seen by many citizens as a positive contributor to urban life. They see governments being called upon to invest in new infrastructures to accommodate the longer ships that require deeper channels, when there are other more pressing urban issues.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0070">A result of these concerns is that port expansion and development especially in Europe and North America has become a time-extensive process. Not only have the commercial justifications for port projects are subject to greater scrutiny, but are also exposed to rigorous environmental and social acceptability assessments. Research on recent projects reveal that several have been abandoned because of negative assessments, such as Dibden Bay in the case of Southampton, while others have required 10&nbsp;years of evaluation in the case of Deurganck Dock of the Port of Antwerp, while that of Maasvlatke II of the Port of Rotterdam took 20&nbsp;years. If this trend continues, it may result in port congestion as ports lose their abilities to cope with trade growth. It also means that by the time projects are realized market and technology may have changed, thus threatening the relevance of the project. The situation is very different in China and many other developing economies, where projects are completed without comparable delays.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0030">The Port as a Regional Hub</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0075">The container has not only allowed ports to achieve high levels of productivity, but has greatly facilitated its transport beyond the port gates. Intermodality has been one of the great beneficiaries of containerization. Other modes of transport can combine to extend services across ever-wider market areas, because the container, as a standard unit of freight, enables relative seemless interchanges between the modes. In this way container ports have opportunities to extend their market areas inland and compete with other ports for business. Ports that can generate more volumes enhance their attractiveness for the ocean carriers, which in turn offer customers a wider range of services that then becomes a competitive advantage over other ports. Ensuring market dominance over a productive hinterland has become a key commercial objective for ports, and this has led academics to explore the process and challenges of what is referred to as &ldquo;port rationalization.&rdquo;</ce:para><ce:para id="p0080">Port rationalization implies not only the attempt to manage and extend the market coverage of ports, but is also tied in with a problem of managing the growth of container traffic in the ports themselves. In many ports traffic growth is causing congestion. This becomes evident at the gates of entry and exit for trucks delivering and picking up containers, in the roads adjacent to the terminals and along corridors through cities. A wide range of solutions are in place to try to resolve congestion at the port gates. These include requiring trucks to make appointments, reducing charges at off-peak times, and extending hours of operation. The results reveal varying degrees of success. One problem with using time as a means of managing truck flows is that truckers are also dependent upon the hours of operation of the warehouses and logistics centers whose schedules may be more restrictive.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0085">More general and extensive solutions to port and urban congestion revolve around promoting other modes of transport, especially rail, and where possible, inland shipping. Effecting a modal transfer is not always simple, since may give rise to operational and issues and involve commercial viability. Even where rivers are navigable the port has to find space for berths required for transferring containers to barges. In the case of rail transfers there are issues of exchanging containers between the port terminals and rail freight yards as well as the interest and ability of the railways to offer efficient services. The result is that solutions are varied and involve different sets of actors. In the case of European ports the lead has been taken by some ocean carriers who operate dedicated rail services from Rotterdam, Le Havre, and Hamburg to inland markets. In the case of barge transfers the ports have played a role, either by subsidizing barge services, as in the case of the Port of New York&ndash;New Jersey (which failed after the subsidy was terminated), or where port authorities form alliances with smaller inland ports to organize barge terminals and coordinate information exchanges as is the case of the port of Rotterdam.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0090">A feature and concept closely related to port rationalization is that of dry ports. These are inland centers linked by dedicated rail service to ports that carry out many of the functions of ports, including customs clearance. Because they have more space they can relieve congested ports, while still ensuring that containers can arrive on time in ports ready for loading, and can store containers after being off-loaded from the ship. They also serve as a means of diverting traffic in hinterland regions from competing ports. Examples include the Dutch inland port of Venlo on the border of the Ruhr, the inland port of Zaragoza established by the port of Barcelona to divert potential traffic from Valencia as well as capture transborder traffic from southern France, and Front Royal, referred to as Virginia Inland Port, established by Virginia Ports Authority to divert Mid West traffic from Baltimore to Norfolk. Dry ports tend to be established by port authorities or private terminal operators.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0095">Academic research indicates that port rationalization combines three levels of activity. First is that of the physical transport infrastructure involving all modes between the seaport and interior markets. Second are the service networks that refer to the direction, capacity, and frequency of transport connections and the actors that operate and manage the transport systems. Third are the flows of freight along the logistics chains that connect the port with customers across the hinterland, which requires understanding of the actors, their roles and activities that manage the flow of goods.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Future Challenges to Ports and Their Hinterlands</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0100">As they enter the third decade of the 21st century ports are confronting challenges that have the potential to modify and even destroy certain features that are taken as granted today. Four basic issues are considered. They are not unique to ports but they are likely to require adjustments or provide opportunities that are distinct. Detailed exploration of these topics is impossible, rather a brief indication of what they are and how they might impact ports is undertaken. The order in which they are presented in no way reflects their importance.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0040">The Energy Transition</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0105">There are growing concerns world-wide about burning of fossil fuels and contributions to the increasing levels of CO<ce:inf>2</ce:inf> in the atmosphere. There are policies in place internationally that are calling for a reduction in their use. For ports, this issue has two dimensions. First is the fact that liquid bulk, especially crude oil and refined products, represents a very important traffic. Many ports regard this as a cash cow, since the revenues generated are realized without significant costs to the port authority. Coal is another product that is threatened, especially since coal-fired thermal stations are being closed down. A decline in traffic would affect the financial health of ports, and in the long run present challenges and opportunities for the possible re-use of liquid bulk terminals. Alternate energy products might be considered, liquified natural gas and liquified petroleum gas are possible substitutes, but there are major concerns about their social acceptability close to urban centers.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0110">The second dimension of fossil fuels is their use within the port area. Already many ports offer &ldquo;cold ironing,&rdquo; where ships in port can turn off their diesel power units by being attached to port electric outlets. There is also a growing trend for the replacement of diesel-powered equipment within the port, such as cranes and vehicles, by electric motors. For the port authority and terminal operators this represents a considerable financial commitment.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Automation and Digitalization</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0115">The modern port achieved its present importance by facilitating world trade through mechanization. Today it is on the cusp of further transformation as a result of automation. Indeed, evidence is already accruing that the digital revolution has begun. One of the trends in container operations is the automation of terminals. Mechanization of ports reduced port labor requirements very significantly, but the tasks of many aspects of port terminal are already digitized, with tracing and tracking of containers from the moment they enter the terminal, as well as their ultimate stowage position on board the vessel. Further automation is already evident in some ports. This includes the use of autonomous machines that physical remove arriving containers from trucks and rail wagons that move them and lift them to storage lines, and, when required, load them on board ship by gantry cranes. Automated terminals now exist in some ports, such as Rotterdam, Singapore, Shanghai, and Los Angeles. Evidence suggests that full automation may not be appropriate at present because of costs for smaller ports or those where traffic is variable with peaks and valleys. On the other hand, the present high capital costs may be expected to be lowered over time. The issue with dock labor remains a challenge.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0120">The container port is a nexus of information. Documentation is essential, but it has many sources (shipper, consignee, insurance company, transport providers, customs and excise, homeland security or equivalent, terminal operators, port authorities). What information is required differs. The result has been the gradual replacement of paper documents and faxes with electronic data interchange. The process may have been speeded up but it is still cumbersome. Estimates suggest the cost of information handling represents 15% of all transport costs. Blockchain technology is being proposed as technology well suited to large networks of disparate partners. As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain establishes a shared, immutable record of all the transactions that take place within a network. It then enables permitted parties access to trusted data in real time. In late 2018 IBM and A.P. Moeller-Maersk formed a partnership to exploit blockchain with several ports.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Cybersecurity and Ports</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0125">Ports, their customers, and related partners all use information systems and communication technologies for equipment operation, cargo movement and tracking, business operations, and security. These not only control the operation of terminals but are also used to monitor security, handle business functions such as invoice preparation and billing. There are different systems in place among the actors. This makes the port community prone to malicious activities and software errors because there are so many points of entry into the systems. In 2013 Maher terminals, a major terminal operator in New York, experienced difficulties in switching between old and new computer systems and the result brought the terminal to a standstill and had impacts on other terminals in the port as well as deliveries throughout the north-east United States. In 2017 Maersk shipping line was attacked by hackers that interrupted operations at 73 ports around the world. It cost the company $300 million to recover from the attack. Cyber attacks have also been reported in the ports of Barcelona, Long Beach, and San Diego.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0130">There are growing calls for better training, regular vulnerability inspections, and in particular, contingency plans. The International Maritime Organization is preparing regulations on cyber security.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Ports and Climate Change</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0135">Climate change is claimed as one of the greatest challenges to humanity. Occupying sites at the interface of land and water, ports are vulnerable to environmental impacts produced by changing climate. Higher sea level, increased storminess, longer periods of high temperatures all have the potential to influence ports and cargo handling. The difficulty, however, is that the changes are not uniform across the world. In some locations it is land that is rising that is resulting in local changes of sea level, in others it is increasing droughts that is the major climate change impact. Consequently, climate change must me addressed at the local level, with the risks assessed and mitigation measures applied case by case. Rather, maritime transport as the greenest of transport modes has the opportunity to improve its position in the global transport industry if the existing black marks of using heavy oil as fuel is changed.<!--<query id="Q2">Please provide minimum five references and their citations as per style.</query>--></ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:bibliography id="bi0010"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Further Readings</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec id="bs0010"><ce:bib-reference id="bib0010"><ce:label>Hall, 2009</ce:label><sb:reference id="ref0010"><sb:contribution><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>P.V.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Hall</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Container ports, local benefits and transportation worker earnings</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>GeoJournal</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>74</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2009</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>67</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>83</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib0015"><ce:label>Hayuth, 2007</ce:label><ce:other-ref id="or0010"><ce:textref id="txr0010">Hayuth, Y., 2007.
