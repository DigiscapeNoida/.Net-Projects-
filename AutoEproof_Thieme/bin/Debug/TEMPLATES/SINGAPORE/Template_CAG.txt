<br><br>2. Open, print, and review the PDF, then make corrections to your hard copy and fax or express mail your corrections to the Proofreader. Indicate any changes or corrections by printing clearly, carefully, and with a dark pen (blue or black ink) in the margin of the proof.

<br>Queries from the copyeditor are listed on the last page of the proof. The text to which the queries refer is indicated on the proof by numbers (e.g. Q1) in the margin. Please ensure these are answered in full.
