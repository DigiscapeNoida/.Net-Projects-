<p><b>Adobe Acrobat Reader Instructions </b><br/>

The Adobe Acrobat Reader allows you to view, navigate, and print PDF files. Acrobat Reader is the free viewing companion to Adobe Acrobat software. To download the latest version of the Acrobat Reader:<br/> 

1. Use your browser to go directly to the address<br/> <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html</a><br/>
 
2. Review the selection options carefully to match the proper Acrobat Reader version to your computer's configuration. Here are some useful pointers: Acrobat Reader version 3.0 does not fully support Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. Acrobat Reader version 3.01 is designed to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, and 4.0. Acrobat Reader version 4.0 is a relatively recent release and has not been extensively tested in the field. <br/>

3. All PDF files produced for the eProof System are Acrobat version 3.x files. Do not use older versions of Acrobat Reader like version 2.1. <br/>

4. PDF files produced by the eProof System will look exactly like your page proofs. However, all images in the PDF are downsampled (reduced to lower resolution and file size) to facilitate Internet delivery. These images will appear at higher resolution and sharpness in the printed article. <br/>

5. Troubleshooting PDF Viewing Problems: Acrobat Reader comes with a help file. Acrobat Reader help file does not provide you a solution, try the Adobe Support Database at 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/database.html ">http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/database.html </a><br/>
6. Additional information about Acrobat Reader can be found at these sites: <br/>
