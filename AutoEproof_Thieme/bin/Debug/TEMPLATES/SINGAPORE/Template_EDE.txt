<p><B>Instructions:</B><br/>

Detailed instructions and offprint order form are available on the eproofing site. Be sure to review these before in advance of proofing your article.</p>

<p><b>Please follow one of the following two options for returning proof corrections:</b><br/>

1) Open and print the PDF, review the article, and send a list of corrections in an email to the Proofreader.  Please note page number, column, and line with each correction. Describe all corrections as clearly and unambiguously as possible.<br/>

2) Open, print, and review the PDF, then make corrections to your hard copy and fax your corrections to the Proofreader. Indicate any changes or corrections by printing clearly, carefully, and with a dark pen (blue or black ink) in the margin of the proof. Attach additional sheet(s) of paper as needed for more complex insertions if space in margin is not sufficient for legible writing of correction. Please type insertions that may be hard to read in handwritten form.</p>

<p>In all cases, be sure to respond to author queries (if any) as listed on the last page and marked throughout the text. Proofread any tables, figure legends, and equations. Check the quality of the figure reproductions.</p>

<p><b>Evolution and Development</b> is covered by Wiley Blackwell Publishing's Early View service, which means that once we have received your corrections, your article will be published online without having to wait for inclusion in a print issue. Please note that the version of your paper that appears online is complete and final, except for volume, issue and page numbers, which are added upon print publication. Therefore, there will be no further opportunity to make changes to your article after online publication.</p>

<p>Any email correspondence should be directed to the Proofreader as noted above.  Please do not reply directly to this message.  See the instruction letter included with your proofs for further details.</p>

<p><B>Queries</B><br/>

Queries from the copyeditor are listed on the last page of the proof. The text to which the queries refer is indicated on the proof by numbers (e.g. Q1) in the margin. Please ensure these are answered in full.</p>

<p><B>Further Instructions</B><br/>

A detailed letter explaining proofing instruction will also be included with your proofs (as a separate PDF file).</p>
