<br><br>Dear JOIC Author:

You must have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange software installed on your computer to use PDF files. Acrobat Reader software is a free download from the Internet. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange installed on your computer, please refer to the downloading instructions at the end of this message. 

<br><br>The Journal of Interventional Cardiology is covered by Wiley Blackwell’s EarlyView service, which means that once we have received your corrections, your article will be published online without having to wait for inclusion in a print issue. Please note that the version of your paper that appears online is complete and final, except for volume, issue and page numbers, which are added upon print publication. Therefore, there will be no further opportunity to make changes to your article after online publication.
