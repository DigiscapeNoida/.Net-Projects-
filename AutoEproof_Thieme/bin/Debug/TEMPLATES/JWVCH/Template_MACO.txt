Dear Author,
Welcome to the Wiley-VCH Journals Production eProofing System, which allows authors to receive the page proofs of their articles as electronic files. eProofs are Portable Document Format (PDF) files generated from the typesetting of your article. You must have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange software installed on your computer to use PDF files. Acrobat Reader software is a free download from the Internet. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange installed on your computer, please refer to Adobe Acrobat Reader Instructions at the end of this message.

To eProof your article:
1.   Open your Internet browser and connect to the Internet.
2.   Activate downloading of the Article Page Proof file and eProof Support Document by double-clicking on the active links to the eProof server shown below.
3.   You will be asked for a username and password to open the Article Page Proof files. This information appears at the top of this e-mail message.
4.   Save the downloaded file to a local directory on your computer's hard drive [for example, c:/temp].

*Option 2: List your corrections in a doc-file giving page number, column and line number (e.g page 403, left column, line 12).

 Option 3: Make your corrections in the PDF file using the markup functions in Acrobat. E-mail the corrected proof as a PDF file (Please note: we cannot use FDF files).
