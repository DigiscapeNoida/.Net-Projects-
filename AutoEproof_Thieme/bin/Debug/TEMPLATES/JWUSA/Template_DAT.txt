The Adobe Acrobat Reader allows you to view, navigate, and print PDF files. Acrobat Reader is the free viewing companion to Adobe Acrobat software.
To download the latest version of the Acrobat Reader:
1)   Use your browser to go directly to the address - http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html
2)   Review the selection options carefully to match the proper Acrobat Reader version to your computer's configuration. Here are some useful pointers:
*    Acrobat Reader is designed to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0.
3)   All PDF files produced for the E-proof System are Acrobat version 4.0 files.
4)   PDF files produced by the E-proof System will look exactly like your page proofs. However, all graphic images in the PDF are downsampled (reduced to lower resolution and file size) to facilitate Internet delivery. These images will appear at higher resolution and sharpness in the printed article.
5)   Troubleshooting PDF Viewing Problems:
*    Acrobat Reader comes with a help file. Please review the READER.PDF file located in your \Acrobat\Help directory.
*    If the Acrobat Reader help file does not provide you a solution, try the Adobe Support Database at http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/database.html.
