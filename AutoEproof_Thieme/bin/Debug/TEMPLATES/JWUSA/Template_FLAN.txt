<p>Please follow <u>one of the following options</u> for returning proof corrections to the journal Proofreader, Simone Payment.</p>  

<p>1) Use PDF mark-up tools to electronically annotate your corrections, and send the corrected PDF to the Proofreader via email. [PREFERRED method, if possible]</p>

<p>2) Write your corrections on a printed copy of the PDF, then FAX or SCAN & EMAIL your corrections to the Proofreader. Indicate any changes or corrections by printing clearly and carefully in the margin with a dark pen. Attach additional sheet(s) of paper as needed if space in margin is not sufficient for legible writing. Please type long insertions/corrections that may be hard to read in handwritten form and email them to the Proofreader.</p>

<p>3) Send a list of corrections in an email to the Proofreader.  Please note page number and line number with each correction. Describe all corrections as clearly and unambiguously as possible.</p>

<p>4) If there are special circumstances and you are unable to email or fax your corrections, the proofreader's mailing address is provided. Please note that mail is not a preferred method of submitting corrections and should be used only if the other options are unavailable to you. </p>

<p>In all cases, be sure to respond to queries (if any) as listed on the last page and marked throughout the text. Any queries from the copyeditor are listed on the last page of the proof. The text to which the queries refer is indicated on the proof by numbers (e.g., Q1) in the margin. Please ensure these are answered in full. If you are unsure of how to answer the queries, or if you have questions, please contact the Editor or Proofreader. </p>

<p>Double check any tables and check the quality of the figure reproductions. <u>Please also note that no substantial changes or re-writing of material are allowed at this stage.</u> </p>
