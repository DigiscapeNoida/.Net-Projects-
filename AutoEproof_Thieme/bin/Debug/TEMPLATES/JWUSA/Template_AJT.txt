<p><b>Instructions:</b> </p>

<p>Open and print the PDF, review the article, and send a list of corrections in an email to the Proofreader.  Please note page number, column, and line with each correction. Describe all corrections as clearly and unambiguously as possible. You can also mark proofs neatly in the margins and fax to the proofreader. There should be no rewriting or revising of your manuscript at this stage.</p>

<p>Please check all numbers (in the text, tables, figures and references). Tables should be checked for proper alignment as well as for content. Clearly note all misspellings and typographical errors. Fill in any missing data in the references. Graphics should be checked for placement only, as the low-resolution image is not indicative of the final appearance of the figure. If you have not previously been in contact with the copy editor and you did not receive a query sheet, please contact me immediately. Please answer all author queries (Q1, Q2, etc.) noted in the margins and detailed on the query sheet. Any queries that are unanswered will be assumed to be satisfactory as they stand.</p>

<p>Any email correspondence should be directed to the Proofreader as noted above. <b> Please do not reply directly to this message.</b> </p>
