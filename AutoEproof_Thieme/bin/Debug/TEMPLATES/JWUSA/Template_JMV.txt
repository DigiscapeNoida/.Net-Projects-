Dear Author:

Welcome to the Wiley Journals Production eProofing System, which allows authors to receive the page proofs of their articles as electronic files. eProofs are Portable Document Format (PDF) files generated from the typesetting of your article. You must have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange software installed on your computer to use PDF files. Acrobat Reader software is a free download from the Internet. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange installed on your computer, please refer to the downloading instructions at the end of this message.

*    Acrobat Reader is designed to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0.
3)   All PDF files produced for the E-proof System are Acrobat version 4.0 files.
4)   PDF files produced by the E-proof System will look exactly like your page proofs. However, all graphic images in the PDF are downsampled (reduced to lower resolution and file size) to facilitate Internet delivery. These images will appear at higher resolution and sharpness in the printed article.
5)   Troubleshooting PDF Viewing Problems:
