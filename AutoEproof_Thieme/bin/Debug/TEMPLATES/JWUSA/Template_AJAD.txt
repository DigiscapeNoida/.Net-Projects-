Instructions: 

Be sure to review these before in advance of proofing your article. 

Please follow one of the following two options for returning proof corrections: 

1) Open and print the PDF, review the article, and send a list of corrections in an email to the Proofreader.  Please note page number, column, and line with each correction. Describe all corrections as clearly and unambiguously as possible. 

2) Open, print, and review the PDF, then make corrections to your hard copy and fax or mail (via courier or express mail) your corrections to the Proofreader. Indicate any changes or corrections by printing clearly, carefully, and with a dark pen (blue or black ink) in the margin of the proof.

Queries from the copyeditor are listed on the last page of the proof. The text to which the queries refer is indicated on the proof by numbers (e.g. Q1) in the margin. Please ensure these are answered in full.
